Hi! This is an impressive work of both great designs as well as attraction. It is convenient that users could experience interest in the nonogram game without a log-in process.

As for the part that could be improved, I found that you implemented most of your functionality in the myDB class. In my opinion, the operations of manipulating the database could be abstracted into several methods that enable code reuse. The myDB class only provides interfaces that are utilized by different routes.

Moreover, there are still great potentials for making improvement in the layout. For example, most of the page content could be wrapped into a container class that restricts its elements in the middle of the page. Margins should be set evenly, and so on.

Best,
