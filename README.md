### Project Objective
***
This project is served as the 2nd project of Web Development course. 
It aims to create a backend application with Node + Express + Mongo and HTML5.
It should contains at least two web pages, at least 2 Mongo Collections and 1 form for interactions.
And the app is deployed by Heroku.

This app is able to play different sizes of nonograms(aka Japanese Puzzles, Kare Karala!).
It has functionalities including puzzle play, user authentication/authorization(register/login), leaderboards display and search puzzle/leaderboard by id.
All of them need interactions between frondend and backend, such as saving records to, and search a puzzle by puzzle id from database.  
From the project, we learn to design app functionaities, implement them accordingly(e.g. utilize Password, Mongo CRUD operations, AJAX Fetch and etc).
